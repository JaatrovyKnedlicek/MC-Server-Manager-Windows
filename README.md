## MC Server Manager
MC Server Manager is a program for helping manage the Minecraft Java Edition server.

## Creating a server
Creating a server is easy. Just follow the steps in the program.

## Starting server
Starting a server is also easy. Just select Start Server. If you want to stop the server write `stop` in to console.

## Managing server
MC Server Manager has server managing tools that can be used. With future updates, I am planning to add more and update existing ones. 

**Server properties**
This tool can be used for changing server settings. The tool will open the `server.properties` file. In this file are values.

**Plugins**
This tool will open the folder in which the server plugins are stored. To install the plugin move it to this folder. For removing the plugin delete it.

> Note: The Plugin can also create a folder. If you are removing the plugin don't forget to remove this folder.

> Note: The bStats folder is used for some plugins staff don't delete it.


**Router settings**
This tool will open your router settings. Because the program can't manipulate your router settings you need to set things manually in it.
**After server commands**
In this tool, you can set the path for the executable which will be executed when the server is stopped. **Not implemented yet!!**
